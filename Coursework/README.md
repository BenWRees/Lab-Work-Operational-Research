  **Data_Structures**
    - dictionary of all possible nodes that can be reached from currently
    - *NEED A DATA STRUCTURE FOR REPRESENTING THE WEIGHTINGS BETWEEN ANY TWO NODES*
    - dictionary of nodes in the path and current weight of path at that node
    - integer that is the current weight of the path
  reached nodes we have a while loop that iteratively runs through these steps:

  1. Iterate through the dictionary of all possible reaching nodes
  2. For every mapping we
